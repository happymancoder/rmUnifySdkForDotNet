This is a simple sample application for the RM Unify SDK for .NET.

It is based on the sample ASP.NET MVC application generated by Visual Studio; we have made minimal changes to allow sign on and sign off with RM Unify.

The RM Unify SDK is automatically downloaded from nuget.org (as are other packages).  To successfully compile this app, you will need to enable package restore in Visual Studio (see "Enabling Package Restore During Build" in http://docs.nuget.org/docs/workflows/using-nuget-without-committing-packages).

Steps to run this sample:

1. Request an RM Unify development establishment from RM.
2. In your development environment, install the RM Unify Dashboard tile (from the App Library) and click on it in the Launch Pad.
3. Add an app with App Launch URL "http://localhost:64025/", SSO Technology set to "WS-Federation", Realm as any URL you own and Reply To URL as "http://localhost:64025/RmUnify/Index".
4. Go back into the App Library and install your new app for all roles in your school.
5. In RmUnify\CallbackApiImplementation.cs, change the value of Realm to be whatever you chose above.
6. Run the app and click on sign in.
